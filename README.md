Red Flag Indicators
The following metrics will trigger red flags in our monitoring systems:

Manual:Automated ratio exceeding 30:70
Regression success rate falling below 95%
MTTR for P1 failures exceeding 4 hours
Test automation implementation time exceeding 2 sprints

Success Criteria
The OKRs will be considered successfully achieved when:

All quarterly milestones are met within their specified timeframes
Red flag indicators remain below threshold levels for at least one month
Improvements are consistently maintained for at least two consecutive quarters

Progress Tracking
Progress will be tracked through:

Automated weekly reports from Grafana dashboards
Monthly OKR review meetings with stakeholders
Quarterly progress assessments and milestone validations
Automated JIRA ticket tracking for implementation delays

Risk Mitigation

Regular assessment of resource availability
Continuous monitoring of technical dependencies
Weekly status updates from all pillar teams
Proactive identification of bottlenecks through metrics analysis
